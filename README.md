# Hip hip array

## Instructions

Fork it, clone it, bop it, twist it!

Once you have it on your machine, run `npm install` and `npm run test`.

You should find lots of failing tests. Now you can go c`[]`zy solving all of the challenges!

It is recommended you attempt the problems in this order:

```js
[
  'levelUp',
  'copyPaste',
  'cleanUp',
  'bigWords',
  'targetPractice',
  'rotate',
  'unduplicate',
  'arraySameOrdered',
  'arraySameUnordered',
  'stepCount'
]
```

You're a wizard, `[]`!

Good luck :four_leaf_clover:
